description: Tiffy is a travel planning freak, formerly an Asia Pacific finance manager  and
  currently a digital marketing ninja. Despite being a nervous flyer  with plane jolts
  sending chills down her spine, Tiffyâ€™s wanderlust has led her  to visit Japan for
  6 times (and counting). Her favorite cities are Kyoto  and Tokyo and would choose
  to visit Japan over Paris in a heartbeat!
